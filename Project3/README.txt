There are 2 versions of the same project in this folder. The first and original is a Python variant that is slow and unoptimized in both practice and algorithmic design. The second is a rewrite in C that is faster and optomized in algorithm, but not in practice. The Python implementation was done for the class, the C implementation was a personal/passion project in order to practice programming in C.

Both implementations use the same post-processing files in MATLAB for contour plotting.
